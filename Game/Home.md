*A game about trying to stage a play*
![](Content/theatermasks1901.svg)

In Line? 2 or more players need to work together to stage a play that no one can remember rehearsing for. This game:
* Focuses on role play
* Has no combat
* Has no discrete losing state
* Requires no dedicated GM
* Requires about an hour


## Needs
* Something to make notes with
* 1 six-sided dice
* Comfort and willingness to perform in character
* If you will tackle difficult topics, make sure everyone has [consented](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/consent-in-gaming/)


## Creative
Players may choose to play as themselves, or create a character to be the performer, but all players need a "creative" that they will be playing. This creative needs a bio in the program. 

Your bio is your character sheet, and it contains:
### Details
A performer needs a name, pronouns, and (though it might seem redundant) an appearance.
### Last Production
What was the last production they've been in? If you'd like, you can also describe how it went.
### Most Embarrassing Stage Moment
What's the most embarrassing thing that has happened to you on stage, what haunts you?
### Preferred Job
A technical job they are good at, some suggestions would be:
* Actor
* Stage Manager
* Set Designer
* AV Designer
* Director
* Assistant


## The Show
The game should begin with the start of the show, one player should declare that they are on stage, that player is [Acting](#Acting), everyone else will start doing [Tech](#Tech). 

Someone on [Tech](#Tech) should say "Lights up on:" with a description of the initial scene. The show should continue until the players find a way to end it. 


## Actions
While the show is going on, those [Acting](#Acting) and doing [Tech](#Tech) can perform actions using dice. Each role has its own list of actions. Whenever you are doing an action, 
* Roll 1d6
* Add 1 if the action is related to your [Preferred Job](#Preferred%20Job).
* Add 1 if the action can be tied back to your experience with your [Last Production](#Last%20Production).
* Subtract 1 if the action can be tied back to your experience with your [Most Embarrassing Stage Moment](#Most%20Embarrassing%20Stage%20Moment).

The total is your Action Value (AV)


## Acting
When your creative is on stage, they are acting. They should be attempting to play one or more characters in the scene, role-playing their motivations and trying to push forward the story. While Acting, you can:
* Role-play by talking
* Give simple descriptions of what you are doing
* Attempt an [Action](#Actions)

Your [Actions](#Actions) are:

### Exit
You try to exit the scene, transitioning to [Tech](#Tech).

| Action Value | Result                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2          | You can't leave now! Everyone is loving this, and you definitely have more lines.     |
| 3-4          | Someone expects a final line from you, you have to say something else before leaving. |
| 5+           | You leave the stage.                                                                  |

### Line?
You can't remember what to say next, maybe someone will help you.

| Action Value | Result                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2          | No one can help you, and you have a line right now, what do you say?                         |
| 3-4          | Someone can whisper the first few words of your line, you need to start your line this way. |
| 5+           | The players can spend a few minutes discussing the line.                                    | 

### Make A Choice
Sometimes you have to make a big choice, whether that be a costume change, large movement, dance, or something else that will wow the audience.

| Action Value | Result                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2          | This was a terrible idea everyone is looking at you like you messed up! You move back to where you were before the big choice, and it's still your line! |
| 3-4          | You should have rehearsed this! Someone is going to need to stall while you finish.                                                                     |
| 5+           | The choice goes off swimmingly.                                                                                                                         | 

### Wait For Cue
You remember there being a cue here, maybe if you look angry enough someone on [Tech](#Tech) will remember.

| Action Value | Result                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-2          | No one is picking up on your hints, everyone on [Tech](#Tech) needs to wait a few lines before doing anything.                       |
| 3-4          | Someone on tech can try to jump in with an [Action](#Actions).                                                                       | 
| 5+           | Someone on [Tech](#Tech) can perform an [Actions](#Actions) with a +1 bonus, and you may provide a suggestion for what it should be. |



## Tech
When your creative is backstage, they are doing tech. They should be listening to those [Acting](#Acting) and trying to help them any way they can. While a tech, you can:
* Speak with other techs about the state of the show
* Attempt an [Action](#Actions)

Your [Actions](#Actions) are:
### Cue
You know something cool was supposed to happen right now you are sure of it, a scene transition, light effect, sound cue, setting a prop, or maybe a projection.

| Action Value | Result                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2          | That's not the right button, something went wrong with this cue, and it's going to take you a few minutes to fix it. |
| 3-4          | The cue happens, smooth enough.                                                                                      |
| 5+           | The cue happens and is integrated perfectly, the next [Acting](#Acting) [Action](#Actions) receives a +1.            | 

### Direct
You remember the blocking for this scene, and they have it all wrong! You're going to have to walk them through it.

| Action Value | Result                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2          | You just walked on! You're going to show them what to do live. You are now [Acting](#Acting).                                               |
| 3-4          | You **must** describe some changes to the blocking and mood of the scene, but can give no justification for those changes.                  |
| 5+           | You can explain to the actors where they should be standing, discuss with the actors their motivations, and what the point of the scene is. | 

### Enter
You think you're on in this scene, you will try entering the scene and start [Acting](#Acting).

| Action Value | Result                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-2          | There is for sure something you need to do before you can get on, you can't join just yet. |
| 3-4          | You need a second to get ready, someone will have to stall with a line.                    |
| 5+           | You enter the scene flawlessly.                                                            |
